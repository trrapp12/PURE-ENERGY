ASSIGNMENT
wk-01 - git & basic html

 Due: Mon, September 26th
Path: Front End Engineering - Salt Lake City - 2016 Fall  Unit: Assignments
git commits with very basic html content

Assignment: git and HTML

Before starting today's assignment, review the following two articles:

How to Write a Git Commit Message
Git Commit Msg
Today's assignment is to create a git repository with a very basic html page. The html page will have subsections centered around photos of your choice.

Today git commits and html content are the critical focus - so don't even think about visual style yet! In keeping with this theme, don't worry if your images seem mis-sized.

Create a new local directory named "wk-01-alpha". Note that from this point on all assigned repo names may be extended to include additional text after the assigned name (e.g. wk-01-alpha-photolog, wk-01-beta-recipes, wk-01-portfolio), but must start with the specified repo name. (FWIW: Only the GitHub repo name must following these conventions. But it's in your best interest to keep them named the same.)
Initialize your wk-01-alpha local directory as a repo.
Today you created a TIY organization (e.g. "metasean-TIY") within your github account. In your TIY GitHub org, create a new repository named "wk-01-alpha". Add your new wk-01-alpha Github repo as a remote for your local repo.

NOTE: Remember to do git commits regularly!
You are now responsible to make git commits regularly.
There are no steps from this point forward telling you when to make git commits.

In your wk-01-alpha directory, create the following:

task.md file
index.html file
.gitignore file
images directory
Save both of the following as your task.md:

## Tasks
  1. [ ] Complete your .gitignore file.
  2. [ ] Flesh out your basic html page.
  3. [ ] Find 5 appropriately licensed images with a common theme (e.g. https://pixabay.com/) and save them to your images directory.
  3. [ ] Create a subsection for each of your photos.  Each subsection should contain the following:
      - a short descriptive heading
      - a descriptive paragraph that includes a link to a related internet page
      - the image
      - a list contain at least 2 keywords for the subsection
  4. [ ] For the *Skilled Sorcerers* & *Wise Wizards* among you, include header, nav, main, div, and footer elements with appropriate content.
  5. [ ] For the *Wise Wizards* among you, create a GitLab repo and add it as a separate remote.  If you're a true gluten for pain, add the necessary .gitlab-ci.yml and submit the GitLab pages url.
  6. [ ] Set your Github page's source to "master branch".

## Criteria
  - appropriate git commits are made –at an absolute minimum– including:
    - [ ] the empty repo
    - [ ] the final repo
  - the html page must include:
    - [ ] at least two heading levels
    - [ ] a paragraph
    - [ ] an image
    - [ ] a link
    - [ ] a list with _**OR**_ w/o bullets
